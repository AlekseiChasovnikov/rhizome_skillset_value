Customers are turned into co-owners of the store via NFTs. NFT owners then source, propose, &amp; vote. Backed by Orange DAO with a team that includes the ex-VP of retail at Casper. Featured on Bloomberg, Yahoo News Japan, The Future Laboratory, NIKKEI, and more. We will launch the world’s first decentralized store with DeStore platform. The retail space is leased in a premier area of San Francisco. Neighboring brands include Allbirds, Warby Parker, and Outdoor Voices. WHAT WE BELIEVE We are building the future of retail. While it may seem that online shopping has taken over, the reality is that offline and online are not mutually exclusive. We believe in combining them to make an exciting single experience. We go to a store because we want to see and feel products, and desire a personal connection with the brands we support. Although we crave something more, current physical retail is still transactional. How we shop in our favorite store has not changed in a very long time. Offline retail needs a re-design to leverage and maximize the experience. All consumers will interact with retailers as stakeholders within the next decade. We will experience the next level of connection. We will be a part of what we love. DeStore will be the infrastructure to empower all retailers to build, grow, and get creative in their retail outlets with the community. WHAT YOU WILL DO This is a full-time position, that will start on a trial basis with a 1-month contractor agreement. In the position, you will be expected to: • Lead the launch of DeStore’s 1st NFT by the end of Q1. • Create a launch strategy and lead it to fruition. • Manage executions, and ensure they’re on brand, budget, and deadline. • Execute (OR delegate, depending on your strategy) the following tasks: • Content creation • PR • Community building and management • Bringing a KOLinfluencer on board • Onboarding a new collaborator and manage them to successfully execute any of the responsibilities listed above that you wish to delegate • … and more. • Maintain and increase the momentum of the community after the launch. • Support founders to fundraise from crypto investors. WHAT YOU WILL BRING Must Have • Successful experience of an NFTToken launch in a Web3-community based project using NFTsTokens as a utility. (Not a PFP project) • Subject-matter-expert level knowledge of community building and Web3 marketing. • Notable experience in a leadership role, developing and executing marketing strategies. (no need to be in Web3) Nice to have • Notable experience working with major consumer-facing NFT-related projects (e.g. RTFKT) • Well-connected in the industry, with the ability to be able to bring KOLs on board if needed in the launch marketing strategy that you would create. • Extensive Twitter experience. • Prior experience working in the retailcommerce industry. • Prior experience in content creation for social media, blog posting, newsletters and so on. • Prior experience in leading PR. • Prior experience growingfounding an early-stage startup. HOW WOULD YOU WORK? • We welcome working with pseudonymity. Pseudonymity is the best way to work with the best talent because pseudonymity minimizes the risk of new challenges by not exposing real identities, even while you’re working a full-time job. So… • you could use a pseudonym. • you could use an avatar and voice-changer for meetings. • you do not need to show us your real identity.

It’s a collectors dream, as they have an NFT but also a physical product stored for them. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It allows anyone to trade and purchase new goods without the need for storing them in or on their own property. This keeps things secure and allows for easy trading if need be.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll be joining the team of developers to build new features to the online marketplace in a full stack web development role using Python, Django and React. You’ll get exposure to the full development lifecycle from day one, including documentation and some application supportbug fixing.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a junior position, so you won’t need to be the most well versed developer, you’ll be able to learn and progress your career here and get to grips with all aspects of the platform. Of course, you’ll learn all about NFTs, Ethereum, Blockchain and even Solidity.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll need to have some experience as a full stack web developer, using Django Rest and React. Any cloud experience would be a huge benefit, it doesn’t matter whether you’ve used AWS, Azure or GCP but most things here are on AWS. The rest is up to you and your attitude to learn. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And, of course, you’ll need to be happy doing this in a fully remote environment.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting salary will be in the range of $80-100,000 plus a bonus that’s around 10% of your salary depending on performance. The benefits package is continuing to evolve as the company grows, but you’ll have private medical insurance. There’s a stock option plan being discussed for the future too.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Want to explore the world of digital assets?

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Job Description&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Our mobile developers keep Square simple and make our users faster and smarter by giving them a designed payments experience and rich data surrounding each transaction.

We will experience the next level of connection. We will be a part of what we love.

It’s a collectors dream, as they have an NFT but also a physical product stored for them. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It allows anyone to trade and purchase new goods without the need for storing them in or on their own property. This keeps things secure and allows for easy trading if need be.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll be joining the team of developers to build new features to the online marketplace in a full stack web development role using Python, Django and React.

Of course, you’ll learn all about NFTs, Ethereum, Blockchain and even Solidity.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll need to have some experience as a full stack web developer, using Django Rest and React.

The rest is up to you and your attitude to learn. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And, of course, you’ll need to be happy doing this in a fully remote environment.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Starting salary will be in the range of $80-100,000 plus a bonus that’s around 10% of your salary depending on performance. The benefits package is continuing to evolve as the company grows, but you’ll have private medical insurance. There’s a stock option plan being discussed for the future too.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Want to explore the world of digital assets?

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Job Description&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Our mobile developers keep Square simple and make our users faster and smarter by giving them a designed payments experience and rich data surrounding each transaction. We&#39;re looking for engineers of all shapes and sizes, who are excited about contributing to outstanding software and solving hard problems. Our challenges span many technologies, including iOS and Android mobile applications. As a mobile developer at Square, you will work on a small team with people across engineering, product, and creative.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;What You Will Impact And Do&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Collaborate with fellow mobile developers to develop, build, test, and release high quality apps to our merchants. &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ensure Square works right, every time, by using testing, continuous integration, and in-depth code reviews&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create interactions and APIs that promote trust, increase security, and make it harder to do the wrong thing&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Contribute to the success of your team&#39;s projects and development&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Envision entire new products, features, and flows that are inspired, considered, and magical&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;You Haveare&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Qualifications&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Available for a full-time 12-week internship opportunity for Summer 2023.
